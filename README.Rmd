<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of graphicalExtremes is to provide an implementation of the statistical 
methodology paper Engelke and Hitz (2019, JRSSB) for sparse multivariate extreme
value models. This includes exact simulation algorithms and statistical 
inference methods for multivariate Pareto distributions on graphical structures.
